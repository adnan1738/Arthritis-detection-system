OBJECTIVE

This study's main goal is to create a machine learning (ML) system that can accurately and effectively detect knee arthritis. In order to determine whether knee arthritis is present, the system will be able to assess data from a variety of sources, including medical imaging, electronic health records, and patient-reported outcomes.
The project's specific goals include gathering and pre-processing information from a range of sources, such as patient feedback, electronic health records, and medical imaging.
Machine learning (ML) algorithms were created and trained utilizing pre-data in order to produce a prediction model for diagnosing knee arthritis. a variety of criteria, such as sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, were used to assess the efficiency of the developed model. Using the technique created to help medical professionals identify.

SCOPE

The future scope of an arthritis detection system using machine learning is quite promising and holds the potential to revolutionize the way arthritis is diagnosed and managed.
With advances in machine learning algorithms and increased access to medical imaging data, the accuracy of arthritis detection systems is likely to improve, leading to more accurate diagnoses and improved patient outcomes.
With the use of machine learning, the diagnosis of arthritis could become more automated, reducing the need for manual interpretation of medical images by healthcare professionals. This would increase the speed and efficiency of diagnoses and reduce the potential for human error.
The integration of arthritis detection systems with wearable devices, such as smartwatches or fitness trackers, could allow for continuous monitoring of joint movements and provide real-time data on the patient's condition.
Machine learning algorithms could be used to monitor the progression of arthritis in patients over time, allowing for earlier intervention and better disease management.

METHODOLOGY

1650 digitized X-rays of the knee joint in the collection were taken by the PROTEC PRS 500E X-ray machine which is used to produce the X-ray images. The 8-bit grayscale images make up the original pictures.
Two medical experts grade each radiographic knee X-ray image separately using the Kellgren and Lawrence ratings. Based on the pixel density, a method has been devised to automatically extract the cartilage region. (region of interest).
The goal is to assess how well the deep learning algorithm predicts grades, according to Kellgren and Lawrence. According to Kellgren and Lawrence, there are four possible outcomes: grades 0 (normal), 1 (doubtful), 2 (Mild) , 3  (moderate) and 4 (severe) . 90% of the data in the dataset is used for training, and the rest 10%,is used for testing.
EfficientNetB5 is a state-of-the-art deep learning model that has shown impressive performance in various computer vision tasks, including image classification. We can use the pre-trained model and fine-tune it using our x-ray image dataset.
Since we have limited data, transfer learning can be used to train the model with a smaller dataset. We can use the pre-trained Efficient B5 model as the feature extractor and add a few additional layers to the model for classification.
Image augmentation is used to generate additional data for training the model. It involves applying random transformations to the input images, such as rotation, flipping, and zooming. We can use the Keras ImageDataGenerator class for image augmentation. 

RESULTS
The model was trained from the dataset after going through all preprocessing and training. After successful training, the model was further submitted for computation of the generated loss and accuracy.
 For Training, we encountered peak rated loss calculated as 0.2211 and the peak rated accuracy was calculated as 0.9796. This shows us that the model is being trained successfully with the dataset after pre-processing stage.
For Testing, we encountered peak rated loss calculated as 1.5748 and the peak rated accuracy was calculated as 0.6138.
The Following is the Classification Report that was generated after Testing Phase, where the parameters to judge the model, were used allotting all the labels associated with it.
The model was able to show that the image belongs to Doubtful Class with a Probability of 0.8850.
